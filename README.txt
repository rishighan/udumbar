This is my first attempt at creating an XBMC skin.
I always wanted to created the XBMC experience in my vision, and so here I am.

Principles:
+ Opinionated - I have firm beliefs about hiding certain options. This is a media center skin, not a productivity OS.
+ Simple
+ Cohesive - Everything from the navigation to the typography should feel like it belongs together.
+ Beautiful - Subjective, yes. I made the best attempts to use beautiful typefaces and iconography.
